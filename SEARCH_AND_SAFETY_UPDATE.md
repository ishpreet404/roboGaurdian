# 🔍 360° Search & Enhanced Safety Update

## New Features Added

### 1. **360° Search Mode When No Person Detected**
- Robot automatically starts slow 360° search when no person is found
- Uses new 'X' command for controlled search turns
- Visual search indicator in GUI with rotating animation
- Auto-stops after 30 seconds to conserve power

### 2. **Increased Safety Distance**
- SAFE_DISTANCE increased from 30cm → **50cm**
- Better obstacle avoidance with larger safety margin
- Enhanced person tracking thresholds for safer approach

### 3. **Slower Search Movement**
- SEARCH_TURN_DURATION = 150ms (vs 200ms normal movement)
- Longer pauses between search commands (400ms vs 100ms)
- More controlled scanning for better person detection

## ESP32 Firmware Changes (`esp32_robot_pi_compatible.ino`)

### New Constants:
```cpp
const int SAFE_DISTANCE = 50;                    // Increased safety
const unsigned long SEARCH_TURN_DURATION = 150; // Slower search turns
bool isSearchMode = false;                       // Search state tracking
```

### New Commands:
- **'X'**: Activates search mode (slow right turn with extended pauses)
- Search mode overrides normal movement timing
- Automatic return to normal mode when person detected

### Enhanced Safety:
- 50cm obstacle detection range
- Search turns are slower and more controlled
- Longer pauses for better sensor readings

## Windows AI Controller Changes (`windows_ai_controller.py`)

### Search Logic:
```python
def process_search_mode(self):
    # Automatic 360° search when no detections
    # Sends 'X' command every 400ms
    # 30-second timeout with 5-second rest
    # Visual feedback in GUI
```

### Enhanced Tracking:
- Tighter centering (12% vs 15% dead zone)
- Smaller minimum approach area (2.5% vs 3%)
- Larger safety zone (25% vs 40% max area)
- Better approach behavior with safety logging

### Visual Feedback:
- "🔍 SEARCHING FOR PERSON..." overlay
- Rotating search indicator animation
- Real-time search status display

## How The 360° Search Works:

### **No Person Detected:**
1. **Auto-Search Start**: "🔍 No person detected - Starting 360° search"
2. **Slow Turns**: Robot turns right slowly (X → pause → X → pause)
3. **Continuous Scan**: 400ms between commands for frame processing
4. **Visual Feedback**: GUI shows search animation and status

### **Person Found During Search:**
1. **Immediate Switch**: Search mode deactivated
2. **Target Lock**: Robot centers on detected person
3. **Safe Approach**: Maintains 50cm safety distance
4. **Controlled Movement**: R/L/F with automatic stops

### **Search Timeout:**
- After 30 seconds: "🔍 Search timeout - Stopping to conserve power"
- 5-second rest period
- Ready to restart search if still no person detected

## Command Sequences:

### **Search Pattern:**
```
No Person → X (150ms turn) → S (150ms pause) → X (150ms turn) → S (150ms pause) → ...
```

### **Person Found:**
```
Person Right → R (200ms turn) → S (100ms pause) → F (200ms forward) → S (100ms pause)
```

### **Safety Override:**
```
Any Mode + Obstacle < 50cm → B (immediate backup) → S (safety stop)
```

## Benefits:
✅ **Automatic Search**: Robot finds people without manual control
✅ **Enhanced Safety**: 50cm obstacle detection prevents collisions  
✅ **Controlled Movement**: Slow, deliberate search and tracking
✅ **Power Management**: Auto-rest prevents continuous searching
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Clear GUI indicators for all modes
✅ **Better Centering**: More accurate person following

## Testing:
1. Upload updated ESP32 code
2. Run Windows AI controller  
3. Enable "Auto Person Tracking"
4. Remove person from view → Watch 360° search activate
5. Return to view → Watch robot center and approach safely

The robot now intelligently searches for people and approaches them with enhanced safety! 🎯
