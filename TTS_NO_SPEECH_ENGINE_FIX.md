# 🔧 TTS "No Speech Engine" Fix Applied

## ❌ **Root Cause Found:**
The warning `🔇 No speech engine available for text playback` occurred because:

1. **espeak test works manually** ✅  
2. **Pi server conditionally initialized TTS** ❌
3. **Fallback speaker only created when assistant_service is None** ❌

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**

### Before (Broken):
```python
if assistant_service is None:
    fallback_speaker = PiFallbackSpeaker()  # Only if no assistant
else:
    fallback_speaker = None  # No TTS if assistant available
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
# Always initialize fallback speaker for TTS functionality
fallback_speaker = PiFallbackSpeaker()

if assistant_service is None:
    # Local reminders
else:
    # Assistant + fallback TTS both available
```

## 🎯 **What This Fixes:**

- ✅ **TTS always available** regardless of assistant service status
- ✅ **espeak detection works** (you confirmed espeak test passes)
- ✅ **Voice reminders will speak** through Bluetooth speaker
- ✅ **No more "No speech engine available" warnings**

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

### 1. Restart Pi Server:
```bash
pkill -f pi_camera_server
python3 pi_camera_server_fixed.py
```

### 2. Test Voice Reminder:
1. Create reminder with voice note: `"Test reminder voice"`
2. Wait for it to trigger (use short delay)  
3. Should hear speech through Bluetooth speaker
4. Pi logs should show: `🔊 Using espeak for speech` + `✅ espeak speech successful`

### 3. Verify Fix:
**Expected Pi server startup logs:**
```
🔊 espeak available as TTS fallback
🔊 Enhanced speech engine ready with Hindi support
```

**Expected reminder logs:**
```  
🔊 Using espeak for speech
✅ espeak speech successful
```

## 📋 **Diagnostic Commands:**

**Test espeak directly:**
```bash
espeak "This is a test"
```

**Test TTS detection:**
```bash
python3 test_tts_detection.py
```

**Check Pi server logs:**
```bash
python3 pi_camera_server_fixed.py | grep -E "(espeak|TTS|speech)"
```

The fix ensures that TTS is **always initialized**, so voice reminders will work whether or not the assistant service is available! 🎉
