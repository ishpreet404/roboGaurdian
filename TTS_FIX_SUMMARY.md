# 🔊 TTS Engine Fix for Voice Reminders

## ❌ **Problem:**
```
2025-09-26 23:26:46,557 - WARNING - 🔇 No speech engine available for text playback.
```

**Cause:** Pi doesn't have TTS (Text-to-Speech) engines installed for voice reminder playback.

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### 1. Enhanced Pi Server TTS Support
**File:** `pi_camera_server_fixed.py`

**Added:**
- **espeak detection** during initialization
- **Multi-engine fallback** system: gTTS → pyttsx3 → espeak
- **Improved error handling** for missing TTS engines

**TTS Priority Order:**
1. 🌐 **gTTS** (Google TTS) - High quality, needs internet
2. 📦 **pyttsx3** - Offline TTS, good quality
3. 🔊 **espeak** - System TTS, always works (basic quality)

### 2. Installation Scripts Created
- **`quick_tts_fix.sh`** - One-command Pi TTS setup
- **`fix_tts_engines.py`** - Comprehensive TTS installer & tester

## 🚀 **How to Fix:**

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
```bash
# On your Pi:
chmod +x quick_tts_fix.sh
./quick_tts_fix.sh

# Restart Pi server:
pkill -f pi_camera_server
python3 pi_camera_server_fixed.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Install
```bash
# Install espeak (basic but reliable):
sudo apt-get install espeak espeak-data

# Test it works:
espeak "Hello World"

# Install Python TTS (optional, better quality):
pip3 install gtts pyttsx3
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

### ✅ **After Fix:**
- **No more "No speech engine available" warnings**
- **Voice reminders will speak** through Bluetooth speaker
- **Multi-engine fallback** ensures TTS always works
- **Hindi language support** (if text contains Hindi characters)

### 🧪 **Test Voice Reminders:**
1. Create reminder with voice note: `"Water the plants"`
2. When reminder triggers → should hear voice through Bluetooth speaker
3. Pi logs should show: `🔊 espeak working!` (or similar)

## 📋 **What Each TTS Engine Does:**

| Engine | Quality | Requirements | Use Case |
|--------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **gTTS** | 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 | Internet | High-quality reminders |
| **pyttsx3** | 🌟🌟🌟🌟 | Offline | Good offline speech |
| **espeak** | 🌟🌟🌟 | Always works | Reliable fallback |

## 💡 **Technical Details:**

The Pi server now automatically:
1. **Detects available TTS engines** during startup
2. **Uses best available engine** for each reminder
3. **Falls back gracefully** if primary engines fail
4. **Logs clear status** about which engine is used

## 🔄 **Next Steps:**

1. **Run TTS fix script** on Pi
2. **Restart Pi server**
3. **Test reminder with voice note**
4. **Should hear clear speech** through Bluetooth speaker! 🎧

The "No speech engine available" warning should be eliminated, and voice reminders should work perfectly with your Bluetooth speaker setup.
