# 🔍 Search Mode & Distance Fix

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Pi Server Updated** (`pi_camera_server.py`)
✅ Added 'X' command to valid commands list
- Now accepts: ['F', 'B', 'L', 'R', 'S', 'X']
- Search mode command will no longer be rejected

### 2. **Distance Thresholds Adjusted** (`windows_ai_controller.py`)
✅ Decreased forward movement distance:
- `min_area`: 2.5% → **5%** (approach much closer before stopping)  
- `max_area`: 25% → **35%** (get closer before safety stop)

### 3. **Enhanced Search Logging**
✅ Added debug logging for search commands
- Shows when search mode activates
- Logs each search turn command

## How It Works Now:

### **Search Behavior:**
```
No Person Detected → Start 360° Search
↓
Send 'X' every 600ms (slow scanning)
↓  
ESP32: X → Right turn for 150ms → Auto stop 150ms
↓
Repeat until person found or 30s timeout
```

### **Approach Behavior:**
```
Person Detected (Far) → Send 'F' (forward)
↓
Person gets closer (5% of screen) → Continue forward
↓
Person very close (35% of screen) → Send 'S' (stop)
↓
Maintain safe distance
```

### **Distance Comparison:**
| Threshold | Before | After | Effect |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|
| Min Area (Forward) | 2.5% | **5%** | Robot approaches much closer |
| Max Area (Stop) | 25% | **35%** | Robot gets closer before stopping |

## Testing Steps:

1. **Restart Pi Server**: 
   ```bash
   # Kill existing server
   sudo pkill -f pi_camera_server.py
   
   # Start fresh server
   python3 pi_camera_server.py
   ```

2. **Test Search Mode**:
   - Run Windows AI controller
   - Enable "Auto Person Tracking"  
   - Move out of camera view
   - Should see: "🔍 No person detected - Starting 360° search"
   - Robot should turn slowly with 'X' commands

3. **Test Closer Approach**:
   - Return to camera view
   - Robot should approach much closer before stopping
   - Watch for "🛑 Person too close" message

## Expected Behavior:

✅ **Search Active**: Robot slowly scans 360° when no person detected
✅ **Closer Approach**: Robot gets much closer to person before stopping  
✅ **No Command Errors**: Pi server accepts 'X' commands
✅ **Smooth Operation**: 600ms between search commands for steady scanning

## If Still Having Issues:

1. **Check Pi Server Restart**: Must restart Pi server to load new command validation
2. **Verify ESP32 Upload**: Make sure latest ESP32 code is uploaded
3. **Monitor Serial Output**: Check ESP32 serial monitor for 'X' command reception
4. **Test Manual 'X'**: Try sending 'X' command manually to verify acceptance

The search should now work smoothly with much closer person approach! 🎯
